# User stories
## Backlog

### Login and account creation (us-1)
**As a new player, I want to be able to create an account and log in so that I can see what the game is about.**

The user needs to be able to input user information, like username and password, and be able to login with these details. The details are to be saved to a database, which in first iteration will just be a csv file stored locally to the user's computer. The data should be saved for the next time the user opens the application. The user may then input the previously saved user details and these will be checked up against details saved in the database. The application should also prevent users from choosing the same usernames.


The user should also be able to see what options they have and the content of the game after logging in. This will be done by the main menu screen which will include buttons to the various features of the game. This includes multiplayer online/local mode, singleplayer practice mode, character information, settings and exit game button.

##### Important to see
* input fields to log in and sign up
* confirmation that user details input correspond to a user saved in the database
* error message if user details input do not correspond to a user saved in the database
* confirmation that your account has been created with your chosen account details
* error message if you try to sign up with an occupied name
* buttons containing main elements of game
##### Important actions
* put in user details in signup
* put in user details in login and log in with said details
* press buttons on main menu screen after login to try out various parts of the game

### Character information (us-2 and us-3)
**As a player that likes fighting games and knows a bit about them, I want to know what moves the different characters have so that I can choose one that fits my playstyle.**

**As a new player that hasn’t played a lot of fighting games, I want to know the playstyles of the different characters so I can get an idea of what might be interesting for me.**

The user needs to easily be able to find information about the game's characters within the game. The game should provide information such as moveset, speed, power, knockback and other attributes that will play an impact in whether or not the player would enjoy this character/the character fits the player's playstyle. The character information will be saved in text format so that new characters and expansions can easily be integrated into the game by following this pattern. The user will be provided with long descriptions but also summaries so that players who just want to get the gist of it and get right into the game can do that, while those who like knowing a bit more about the game can read the detailed descriptions.

##### Important to see
* easily accessible information about character attributes and moves with detailed descriptions
* easily understand the gist of a character with more beginner friendly information, keywords instead of long descriptions
* visuals supplementing text to easier see how a move works
* information about how to unlock this character (might be kept secret or with hints)
##### Important actions

* click character moves to see animation of them

### Local singleplayer (us-4)
**As a new player I want to be able to try out new characters before taking them to the battlefield so that I know how to play them.**

The user needs to be able to try out characters in a singleplayer mode with a training dummy before trying them out against real players. The dummy will in first iteration only be a stationary character with hitbox and hurtbox, but might in later iterations involve some sort of AI fighter (though most likely the project span does not give sufficient time for that). Here the player can use the different moves of the character and see how they work, as well as do secret combos to unlock new characters (maybe?).
##### Important to see
* a selection screen with all possible characters the player can pick from
* feedback on which character has been pressed and chosen
* a button to confirm chosen character

### Online/local gameplay (us-5)
**As a gamer I want to test my skill against others around the world to see who’s the best.**

The user needs the possbility to play with others who play the game through internet or locally on the same computer. Online will make it easier to be able to play with friends that might live far away, or play with new people from around the world, while local will be easier to implement. The player needs to be able to find their friends' users and invite them to a game or set the user details of the other local character to that user. In first iteration you will only be able to play against people you choose and know, but future iterations might include a matchmaking system. In addition a friends list and system to save people you want to play with would be preferable.

### Tutorial (us-6)
**As a child who is new to video games I want to get sufficient information and tutorial on how to play so that I can start playing.**

The user has no way of knowing the controls for the game from the get-go, and as such a tutorial on start-up is required. This will be a popup that pops up the first time you play and can be closed. However, in case the user misclicks the exit button or forgets the rules or controls of the game, it should be possible to find this page again easily. As such, a help button should bring the popup back up. It might be nice to have a tooltip pop up after closing the popup that shows where you can find the tutorial later.

* exit button to close tutorial
* easy to spot button to make the tutorial pop back up

The user needs to be able to be rewarded by the game for playing. Achievements will reward the player for playing, as well as provide a goal for users to keep playing and something to reach for. Users that do not take the game itself competitvely but still want to have something to work towards, can instead focus on these achievements. A page containing the achievements should show which are locked and unlocked, as well as provide a tooltip on how to unlock on hovering.

### Skip tutorial (us-12)
**As a player that is already experienced with this game or similar ones, I would like to be able to skip the explanation of the game and tutorial.**

The user needs to be able to skip the tutorial, and as such it should not pop up on each startup. There should be a variable telling if the user is a first time user or not, and the tutorial should only pop up if it is the user's first time playing the game. Otherwise, the tutorial will be available on the main menu screen, but will not be forced upon the player every single time they open the game. Most of the implementation of this user story will be done in the background, with keeping track of whether or not the player has seen the tutorial before and whether or not it should be shown. One option is to have a variable keeping track, but this can also be done knowing that the user is a first time user every time they press the signup button instead of the login button.
##### Important to see
* exit button for tutorial
* no tutorial popup on later logins to the game
##### Important actions
* close tutorial
